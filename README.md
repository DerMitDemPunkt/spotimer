Spotimer - a script to start and stop Spotify automatically
Short Description

You can use Spotimer to:

    start your Spotify-Client
    close your Spotify-Client after an adaptable amount of time
    Shutdown your Windows-System

Requirements

Spotimer needs:

    a Windows-Plattform (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 are tested, others will probably work too)
    Spotify Desktop-Client (It won't work with the Webplayer-Version)

Installation

    get Spotify and install it
    get Spotimer und unzip it
    run Spotimer_installation.bat

Configuation

    run Spotimer_configuration on your desktop

    you can choose between
        new (will create a new configuration, you can specify some options after choosing 'new'. Will overwrite the old configuration)
        quit (will close the configuration-dialog without! saving anything)
        remove (will completly remove spotimer from your system)

    if you selected "new" you can choose:
        Choose Runtime of Spotimer (a bit misleadingly.. its the time in sec. that you allow Spotify to run before Spotimer will close it. Example:3600 = 1h)
        Spotify Autostart = (if set to 'yes' it will launch Spotify each time Spotime is started)
        Windows Shutdown (experimental) = (if set to 'yes' the script will try to shutdown Windows after Spotidfy has been closed)
    after setting the parameters wich are descripted above, you can check them and accept the configuration or restart the configurationprocess.)
        next (save your configuration)
        new (restarts the configurationdialog)
        quit (quits the script without saving)
